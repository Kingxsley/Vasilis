## Human + AI Powered Security Awareness Training

## The Problem

**91% of cyberattacks begin with a phishing email.**

Organizations invest millions in technical security solutions, yet the weakest link remains unchanged: **human error**. Your employees are your first line of defense—and your greatest vulnerability.

### The Cost of Inaction:
- **$4.45 million** — Average cost of a data breach (IBM, 2023)
- **74%** of breaches involve the human element
- **3.4 billion** phishing emails sent daily worldwide
- **60%** of small businesses close within 6 months of a cyberattack

## The Solution: Vasilis NetShield

Vasilis NetShield is a comprehensive **Security Awareness Training Platform** that transforms your employees from security liabilities into your strongest defense.

### Our Approach:
We combine **realistic attack simulations** with **AI-powered adaptive training** to create lasting behavioral change—not just checkbox compliance.
